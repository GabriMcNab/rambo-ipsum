  "You did everything to make this private war happen. You've done enough damage. This mission is over, Rambo. Do you understand me? This mission is over!",
  "Look at them out there! Look at them! If you won't end this now, they will kill you. Is that what you want? It's over Johnny. It's over!",
  "Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off! It wasn't my war! You asked me, I didn't ask you! And I did what I had to do to win! But somebody wouldn't let us win!",
  "And I come back to the world and I see all those maggots at the airport, protesting me, spitting. Calling me baby killer and all kinds of vile crap! Who are they to protest me, huh? Who are they?",
  "It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now.",
  "You're the last of an elite group, don't end it like this.",
  "I could have killed 'em all, I could've killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Don't push it! Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe. Let it go. Let it go!",
  "I don't think you understand. I didn't come to rescue Rambo from you. I came here to rescue you from him.",
  "Well, we all appreciate your concern Colonel, I will try to be extra careful!",
  "I'm just amazed he allowed any of your posse to live.",
  "Is that right? Strictly speaking, he slipped up. You're lucky to be breathing.",
  "That's just great. Colonel, you came out here to find out why one of your machines blew a gasket!",
  "You don't seem to want to accept the fact you're dealing with an expert in guerrilla warfare, with a man who's the best, with guns, with knives, with his bare hands.",
  "A man who's been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke.",
  "In Vietnam his job was to dispose of enemy personnel. To kill! Period! Win by attrition. Well Rambo was the best.",
  "We were in this bar in Saigon and this kid comes up, this kid carrying a shoe-shine box. And he says \"Shine, please, shine!\" I said no.",
  "He kept askin', yeah, and Joey said \"Yeah.\" And I went to get a couple of beers, and the box was wired, and he opened up the box, fucking blew his body all over the place.",
  "And he's laying there, he's fucking screaming. There's pieces of him all over me, just...",
  "like this, and I'm tryin' to pull him off, you know, my friend that's all over me! I've got blood and everything and I'm tryin' to hold him together!",
  "I'm puttin'... the guy's fuckin' insides keep coming out! And nobody would help! Nobody would help!",
  "He's saying, sayin' \"I wanna go home! I wanna go home!\" He keeps calling my name! \"I wanna go home, Johnny! I wanna drive my Chevy!\" I said \"With what? I can't find your fuckin' legs! I can't find your legs!\"",
  "Are you telling me that 200 of our men against your boy is a no-win situation for us?",
  "You send that many, don't forget one thing. What? A good supply of body bags.",
  "It's good to hear your voice Johnny, it's been a long time. Look John, you've done some damage here, they don't want anymore trouble. That's why I've come.",
  "I want to come in there and fly you the hell out. Just you and me. We'll work this thing out together. Is that fair enough?",
  "Where did you come from Sir? Bragg. I tried to get in touch with you, but the guys in Bragg never knew where to find you.",
  "You know I haven't been spending much time there lately, they've got me down in D.C. I'm shining a seat with my ass.",
  "I wish I was back in Bragg now. We'll talk about that when you come in. I can't do that Sir.",
  "Look John, we can't have you running around out there killing friendly civilians. There are no friendly civilians!",
  "But I'm your friend Johnny! I was there with you knee-deep in all that blood and guts. I covered your ass more than once. Seems like baling you out of trouble's got to be a life-time achievement for me.",
  "There wouldn't be no trouble except for that king-shit cop! All I wanted was something to eat. But the man kept pushing Sir.",
  "Well you did some pushing on your own John. They drew first blood, not me. Look Johnny, let me come in and get you the hell out of there! They drew first blood...",
  "Rambo, are you still reading me? Covey leader to Raven! Rambo! Acknowledge!",
  "He was just another drifter who broke the law!",
  "Here lies John Rambo, winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines. Killed for vagrancy in Jerkwater, USA.",
  "Now don't give me any of that crap Trautman. Do you think Rambo was the only guy who had a tough time in Vietnam? He killed a police officer for Christ's sake!",
  "You're goddamn lucky he didn't kill all of you.",
  "I can't get it out of my head. A dream of seven years. Everyday I have this. And sometimes I wake up and I don't know where I am. I don't talk to anybody. Sometimes a day - a week. I can't put it out of my mind.",
  "Freeze! Stand right where you are! Give yourself up!",
  "But I didn't do anything!",
  "I'm warning you boy, don't make a move or I'll blow your head off! Drive! Don't look at me, look at the road! That's how accidents happen.",
  "What have you got in the back, Robert A? M-60 Please. I got no beef with you.",
  "GO ON! Get out! Go home!",
  "Assholes!",
  "God didn't make Rambo, I made him!",
  "Company leader to identify Baker Team - Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta, Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer confirm! This is Colonel Trautman. Talk to me, Johnny. They're all gone Sir.",
  "Rambo! Are you all right? Baker Team. They're all dead, sir. Not Delmar Berry, he made it. Berry's gone too Sir. How?",
  "Got himself killed in 'Nam, didn't even know it. Cancer ate him down to the bone. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I'm the last one Sir.",
  "Portland is south! You said you were heading north.",
  "You got some place I can eat around here? Theres a diner about thirty miles up the highway.",
  "Is there a law against me getting something to eat here? Yeah! ME!",
  "Why you pushing me? I said why you pushing me? I haven't done anything to you.",
  "They found Rambo's body. As a matter of fact, it stole an army truck. Blew up a gas station the other side of town.",
  "The kid is resiliant. Now why don't you forget what you're thinking and clear out while you can?",
  "I came to get my boy. I recruited him. I trained him. I commanded him for three years in Vietnam. I'd say that makes him mine.",
  "What's the matter, Mitch? Don't you like water sports?",
  "If you don't fly this thing right, I swear to god I'm going to kill you.",
  "Let's do some huntin'!",
  "Hunting? We ain't huntin' him, he's huntin' us!",
  "Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before what makes you think you can handle him now? Only God knows what damage he's prepared to do.",
  "Hey. If you're looking for trouble, you've come to the right place buddy.",
  "Everybody dies.",
  "You picked the wrong man to push. No, Trautman. HE picked the wrong man!",
  "Why don't you let the state police handle this? Why didn't you leave the kid alone in the first place?",
  "Dammit, Dave, you think this kid just waltzed into town, announced he was a Medal Of Honor winner, and then I just leaned on him for the hell of it?",
  "I tried to do him a favor, I treated him like he was one of my neighbor's kids. I did my job, Dave, I booked him for vagrancy and resisting arrest.",
  "You seem pretty motivated on this one.",
  "Why don't you go out there and take a look at what's left of my men? You'll see how motivated I am, Dave",
  "All right, Will, I read you. Listen, I got twenty-five men I can bring up from Monroe.",
  "How blind are you? Can't you see this guy's crazy? Can't you see I don't give a shit?",
  "Goddammit, what the hell do you think this is? Some kind of a circus?",
  "Can you tell me if Delmar Berry lives here?",
  "Setting him up for you? That's like bringing the pigeons to the cat.",
  "What's that? It's blue light. What does it do? It turns blue.",
  "This is Afghanistan... Alexander the Great try to conquer this country... then Genghis Khan, then the British. Now Russia.",
  "But Afghan people fight hard, they never be defeated. Ancient enemy make prayer about these people... you wish to hear? Um-hum.",
  "Very good. It says, 'May God deliver us from the venom of the Cobra, teeth of the tiger, and the vengeance of the Afghan.' Understand what this means?",
  "That you guys don't take any shit? Yes... something like this.",
  "Are you insane? One man against trained commandos... Who do you think this man is? God? No. God would have mercy. He won't.",
  "What do you say, John? Fuck 'em!",
  "Who are you? Your worst nightmare!",
  "How's the wound? You taught us to ignore pain, right? Is it working? Not really. Don't take it personal.",
  "Can you fly that helicopter? Let's find out!",
  "You got any ideas? Surrounding them's out. Hell of a time for humor, John.",
  "I'm sorry I got you into this Johnny. No you're not.",
  "You expect sympathy? You started this damn war! Now you'll have to deal with it!",
  "And we will. It is just a matter of time before we achieve a complete victory.",
  "Yeah, well, there won't be a victory! Every day, your war machines lose ground to a bunch of POORLY-armed, POORLY-equipped freedom fighters!",
  "The fact is that you underestimated your competition. If you'd studied your history, you'd know that these people have never given up to anyone.",
  "They'd rather DIE, than be slaves to an invading army. You can't defeat a people like that. We tried! We already had our Vietnam! Now you're gonna have yours!",
  "That was close John. How are you?",
  "You do not look like men Griggs sent before. You not look like you are with military. I'm not.",
  "What you are? Mercenary?",
  "You're not with military, not mercenary - what you are? Lost tourist? I'm no tourist.",
  "Now you see how it is here. Somewhere in the war there's supposed to be honor. Where's the honor here? Where? Now, we're taking the survivors to the border. Are you coming?",
  "I'm going to the fort.",
  "Have you not seen enough death? Go! Go while you can! This isn't your war. It is now.",
  "So be it. You're a good friend.",
  "The Kremlin's got a hell of a sense of humor.",
  "You talk peace and disarmament. And here you are wiping out a race of people!",
  "Let me tell you a story, John. There was a sculptor. He found this stone, a special stone. He dragged it home and he worked on it for months until he finally finished it. When he was ready he showed it to his friends.",
  "They said he had created a great masterpiece, but the sculptor said he hadn't created anything. The statue was always there, he just chipped away the rough edges.",
  "You're always going to be tearing away at yourself until you come to terms with who you are. Until you come full circle.",
  "Well, I do not know who you really are. But by the way you look, I can see you have no experience in war, do you? C'mon, do you?",
  "You did? Well... This is your choice. But let me tell you, you cannot get this American alone. If you fail, do not blame me. I will accept no responsibility.",
  "Sounds familiar...",
  "Why must you do this? Cause he'd do it for me. Hard to believe, John.",
  "What's that, sir? Well, I hate to admit it, but the truth is, I think we're getting soft. Maybe just a little, sir. Just a little.",
  "John where are you going? I don't know.",
  "You'll get a second medal of honor for this. You should give it to them. They deserve it more.",
  "You don't belong here, why don't you come back with me? Back to what? My friends died here, and a piece of me did too.",
  "The war, the whole conflict may have been wrong, but damn it, don't hate your country for it. Hate? I'd die for it.",
  "Then what is it you want?",
  "I want, what they want, and every other guy who came over here and spilled his guts and gave everything he had, wants! For our country to love us as much as we love it! That's what I want!",
  "How will you live, John? Day by day.",
  "Why did they pick you? Because you like to fight? I'm expendable. What mean expendable?",
  "It's like someone invites you to a party and you don't show up. It doesn't really matter.",
  "Murdock... He's here.",
  "Rambo, this is Murdock, we're glad you're alive. Where the hell are you? Give us your position and we'll come to pick you up!",
  "Murdock... I'm coming to get you!",
  "Rambo, I swear to God, I didn't know it was supposed to happen like this. It was just supposed to be another assignment!",
  "Mission... accomplished.",
  "You know there's more men out there and you know where they are. Find 'em. Or I'll find you.",
  "Good luck, son.",
  "Murdock said he was with 2nd Battalion 3rd Marines at Kon Tum in '66.",
  "Yeah. The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank. You're the only one I trust.",
  "To survive a war, you gotta become war.",
  "John, I want you to try and forget the war. Remember the mission. The old Vietnam's dead.",
  "Sir, I'm alive. It's still alive, ain't it?",
  "Colonel, are you sure Rambo's still in balance with the war? We can't afford having him involved in this mission and then crack in the pressure of that hell.",
  "what you choose to call hell, he calls home.",
  "Now if there's any of our men in this POW target camp you confirm their presence by taking photographs.",
  "Photographs? Just photographs. Under no circumstances are you to engage the enemy!",
  "I'm supposed to leave 'em there? don't engage the enemy!",
  "I see you are no stranger to pain. Perhaps you have been among my Vietnamese comrades before, hm? No answer.",
  "Do you wish to give your name? Now, what possible harm can that cause? Pride is a poor substitute for intelligence.",
  "What you must understand is that we have to interrogate you. To Sergeant Yushin here, you are a piece of meat. A laboratory experiment.",
  "But to me, you are a comrade, similar to myself, just opposed by an act of fate.",
  "I know you are trying to facilitate the release of war criminals held by this republic. I can appreciate this.",
  "But this incident, your capture is... embarrassing. We must have explanation.",
  "First of all, I wish you to radio your headquarters and say that you have been captured and condemned for espionage activities, and that no such criminal aggression should be attempted in the future or they will meet with the same fate as yours. Fuck you.",
  "What are you doing? Do you know what the hell you've done?",
  "Don't act so innocent, Colonel. You had your suspicions, and if you suspected then you're sort of an accessory aren't ya?",
  "Don't ever count me with you and your scum! It was a lie wasn't it? Just like the whole damn war, it was a lie!",
  "What are you talking about? That camp... was supposed to be empty. Rambo goes in, a decorated vet, he finds no POWs, the Congress buys it - case closed!",
  "And if he happens to get caught, nobody knows he's alive except you and your computers... and you can reprogram that can't you?",
  "Who the hell do you think you're talking to, Trautman? A stinkin' bureaucrat who's tryin to cover his ass!",
  "No, not just mine Trautman. We're talkin' about a nation here! Besides, it was your hero's fault.",
  "Now if your warrior had gone in and done what the hell he was supposed to do, we'd be out of this clean and simple. He was just supposed to take pictures!",
  "And if those pictures showed something they would have been... lost... wouldn't they?",
  "Oh Trautman, I still don't think you understand what this is all about.",
  "The same as it always is! Money! In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong four-and-a-half billion in war reparations.",
  "We reneged, they kept the POWs... and you're doing the same thing all over again.",
  "And what the hell would you do, Trautman? Pay blackmail money to ransom our own men and finance the war effort against our allies?",
  "What if some burn-out POW shows up on the six o-clock news? What do you want to do... start the war all over again? You wanna bomb Hanoi?",
  "You want everybody screaming for armed invasion? Do you honestly think somebody's gonna get up on the floor of the United States Senate, and ask for billions of dollars for a couple of forgotten ghosts?",
  "Men, Goddamn it! Men... who fought for their country!",
  "That's enough! Trautman, I'm gonna forget this conversation ever took place. You bastard!",
  "And if I were you... I'd never make the mistake of bringing this subject up again.",
  "Oh you're the one who's making the mistake. Yeah? What mistake? Rambo.",
  "Wolf Den, this is Lone Wolf. Do you read? Prepare for emergency landing. Arriving with American POWs.",
  "Rambo, you can feel totally safe because we have the most advanced weapons in the world available to us.",
  "I've always believed that the mind is the best weapon.",
  "Times change. For some people.",
  "Like you said, Colonel, he went home."]
